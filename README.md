# llsif-server-emulator
LLSIF server emulator: a self-hostable game server that emulates the functions of the real LLSIF server (the only one right now is JP).

This project is made for preservation of the game known as Love Live School Idol Festival or also known as [LLSIF](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=klb.android.lovelive_en). Currently as of writing this (24/9/2021), many do not like how the company is treating the game and content. I suspect it will become dead and they'll shut down the server soon. I don't like when things like this happen but with this project we will be able to continue playing if thats the case!

`node index.js` To run the server...
