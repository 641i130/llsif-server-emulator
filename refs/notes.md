# NOTES on what the plan is

### Where I am currently
- I have a very basic skeleton on what the post requests will be. I have also saved a bunch of HAR requests so I can make the requests based off of them. I'm nervous there will be some client server verification thing but if they're using HTTP then I hopefully shouldn't have to worry.
- I am able to use pihole to redirect the server to my pc, once I set it up I can change the dns server since the android device I'm on is rooted. 

- Once I have a decent level of requests down and its playable without internet, I'll get a demo video out and get more people to contribute. Maybe we can even modify the app so it only uses the private server (or even crazier, we host this private server on a VPS so we can get better server speeds lmao)
